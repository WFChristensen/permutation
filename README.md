# permutation
This repository contains R code that can be used to replicate the computations found in the Simulation and Examples sections of the article "When your permutation test is doomed to fail"
 
Files:
- SimulationFunctions.R : contains all R functions needed for the simulations and calculations for the example data sets
- PowerSimulations.R : contains R code for reproducing simulations of the type described in Section 4 of the manuscript
- examples.R : contains the data and R code necessary to reproduce the examples in Section 5 of the manuscript
